Clean Code - Easier to Maintain and Update
Performant Code -  Better Performance

Clean Code is usually slower than Performant Code

Choose the best method according to the scenario

git commands
git --global alias.(func name) (a git function or a executable script)
ex. git --global alias.forced force-with-lease

Objective goals sometimes provides a different perspective to view a problem or when solving, provides you with new knowledge.
    - (Objective goals are goals like writing the shortest possible program/code, shortest time, shortest space, etc)

Therefore, Do everything with an open mind and with full motivation to be able to learn 
                                                                            (In depth (More in one field) 
                                                                            or in Breadth (More fields))

Object Orient Programming (OOP) - Implements a Domain Model into A system
    - However, You Should Not Implement A Compile-Time Heirarchy of Encapsulation of a Domain Model
        - There is a difference between how the universe views a person (Computaionally) compared to how another person views them
            - Basically The system doesnt have to encapsulate data into a fatty struct (Struct that has a lot of elements) just to suit the domain model as it would then provide difficulties in using the system
            - Therefore, there could exist a system that is omniscient and omnipotent such that they can view over all of one thing
                - Instead of Entity.get(Property), you could do Property.get(Entity) as well (Depending on the system)

    - There is a difference between reusing an architecture and using an architecture that reuses code 
        - There is no one solution that fits all

    - OOP is how it is due to (HISTORY) with people's background that predisposes them to view something as beneficial than others such that the modularity of OOP is prioritied instead of the architectural benefit of Discriminant Union and so on from Systems such as SketchPad.

Lack of Action and Too Much Thoughts Creates Stress or Fear
